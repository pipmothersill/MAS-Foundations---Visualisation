election-example
================

A silly example on Processing that reads in 2012 US election results and draws them as text.
Open the Election.pde to run the example.  Modify the code to do something more interesting.

Data

The data was sourced from the Guardian Data Blog. Their state data seems accurate, though 
incomplete.  Their county data looked suspicious to me.  Good enough for this playground.
